## [1.0.10](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_AmpliconSeq_Workflow/tree/NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.10)

### Added

- Option to run workflow in accession mode using a local ISA archive (`--isa_archive` parameter)
- Caching support for reference databases to avoid redundant downloads on repeated runs of the main workflow
- A Bioconductor package (microbiome 1.32.0) that is required by ANCOMBC >= 2.12
- Support for `--primers-already-trimmed` behavior in the post-processing workflow by adding `trim_primers` parameter to control inclusion of trimmed-data-related information across its processes
- Validation for alpha/beta diversity outputs, including failure files and rarefaction depth consistency across both analyses, for taxonomy plots, and for outputs of the three differential abundance methods, including per-method volcano plot counts against number of contrasts
- `post_processing_schema.json` for parameter validation and automated help menu generation


### Fixed
- Write a failure text file and continue when metadata has fewer than two groups for beta diversity and differential abundance (ANCOMBC1/2, DESeq2), same as alpha diversity

### Changed
- Drop groups with fewer than 2 samples before ANCOMBC1 and ANCOMBC2 and write them to `samples_dropped<assay_suffix>.txt`
- Changed `concatenate_reads_only` from a `"TRUE"`/`"FALSE"` string to a boolean (`true`/`false`)
- Migrated output handling to Nextflow `workflow output {}` block in both main and post-processing workflows; removed deprecated suffix and directory parameters from `nextflow.config` and `post_processing.config`
- Switched output files under `Metadata/` and `GeneLab/` to comply with other GeneLab workflows
- Replaced `GET_RUNSHEET` process and associated workflow logic with a new staging analysis subworkflow supporting both accession-based and input-file-based execution modes
- Consolidated `CUTADAPT_ANCHORED` and `CUTADAPT_UNANCHORED` into a single `CUTADAPT` process
- Consolidated `RUN_R_TRIM` and `RUN_R_NOTRIM` into a single `RUN_DADA2` process
- Updated `CUTADAPT` and `RUN_DADA2` to accurately support both true single-end datasets and forced single-end processing in addition to the existing paired-end processing
- Updated `GENERATE_README`, `GENERATE_MD5SUMS`, `VALIDATE_PROCESSING`, and `GENERATE_CURATION_TABLE` to account for the `force_single_end` parameter
- Consolidated `ZIP_BIOM` into the general `ZIP` process using file extension detection for biom-specific flags
- Split MultiQC zip output into separate `data.zip` and `report.html` outputs
- Moved MultiQC path cleaning into the `MULTIQC` process via `clean_multiqc_paths.py`; removed standalone `MULTIQC_ZIP` process in main workflow and `CLEAN_MULTIQC_PATHS` process in post-processing workflow
- Moved `MultiQC_Reports/` from under `FastQC_Outputs/` to under their respective folders (`Raw_Sequence_Data` or `Filtered_Sequence_Data`); removed `FastQC_Outputs/`
- Converted `generate_protocol.sh` to a Python script for automated handling of reference/filtering parameters and special cases (primers already trimmed, processing only forward or reverse reads)
- Replaced bash code that generates md5sums file with `generate_md5sums.py` that provides md5sums for files published on OSDR only and optionally generates md5sums for raw data (FASTQ and MultiQC files)
- Moved post-processing output files from under `Post_Processing/` to under `GeneLab/`; removed `Post_Processing/`
- Modified `nextflow_schema.json` to reflect updated pipeline parameters with improved parameter descriptions and group definitions 
- Wired up `nf-schema` plugin to `nextflow_schema.json` for parameter validation and automated help menu generation
- Updated `post_processing.config` to support running the post-processing workflow with `-C` instead of `-c` (i.e., disregards the default `nextflow.config` and uses only `post_processing.config` ); modified launch scripts (`launch.sh` and `slurm_submit.slurm`) accordingly 

- Updated database versions:
  - SILVA_SSU_r138.2_v2, downloaded from DECIPHER and uploaded to Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.32118616) in April 2026 
  - UNITE_v2025, downloaded from DECIPHER and uploaded to Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.32118652) in April 2026

- Updated versions of Cutadapt and certain R/Bioconductor packages to match GeneLab Amplicon Pipeline version [GL-DPPD-7104-D](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Amplicon/Illumina/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7104_Versions/GL-DPPD-7104-D.md)
- Replaced tidyverse package with its individually-used component packages across R scripts to ensure specific versions of these packages are being used:
  - ggplot2 4.0.2
  - dplyr 1.2.1
  - readr 2.2.0
  - stringr 1.6.0
  - purrr 1.2.1
  - tibble 3.3.1
  - tidyr 1.3.2
- Removed explicit `library(tools)` loading from R scripts and its respective version capture, as it is automatically loaded with R base
- Bumped `r-diversity` and `r-dada-decipher-biomformat` singularity images from 1.1 to 1.2 to match R package updates 
- Updated third-party licenses

### Fixed
- Fixed `assay_suffix` chained parameter evaluation, which was previously evaluated at parse time instead of runtime

### Removed
- Removed `run_workflow.py` script as it was deemed unnecessary for the Nextflow workflow setup; cleaned up related commands in `slurm_submit.slurm`
